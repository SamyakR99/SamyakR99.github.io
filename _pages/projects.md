**End to End Number Plate Recognition [[code]](https://github.com/ShubAn1901/License-Plate-Recognition)** <br> *Advisor- [Prof Arjun Jain](http://arjunjain.co.in/), IIT Bombay* <br>
- Implemented system for detecting bounding box and recognizing characters of a plate, with over 92% accuracy.
- Trained the system End to End, backpropagating on a single combined loss from both the box detector and digit
recognizer, over more than 250,000 images in the CCPD dataset

**Face Image De-Specularization** <br> *Advisor- [Prof Cham Tat-Jen](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=ASTJCHAM&CategoryDescription=interactivedigitalmedia), NTU Singapore* <br>
- Reviewed and analyzed issues with accurate face recognition in images with specular reflection
- Applied transfer learning from reflection removal domain to deal with specular reflection in face images

**Enabling deep learning for IoT with efficient scheduling [[poster]](https://shubhangb97.github.io/files/Deep_Learning_IoT.pdf)**<br> *NTU Singapore* <br>
- Analyzed use of deep learning in IoT devices with a focus on using edge models for deployment
- Studied use of efficient scheduling algorithms using online learning to enable use of edge and cloud computing for this, presenting a poster on the same



**Iris Recognition [[slides]](https://shubhangb97.github.io/files/Iris_Recognition.pdf)**<br> *Advisor- [Prof Suyash Awate](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/) and [Prof Ajit Rajwade](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ajitvr/), IIT Bombay* <br>
- Pre-processed the images using Adaptive histogram equalization and removed the pupil using segmentation
- Used PCA to reduce dimensionality of the data and applied Fisher’s LDA achieving more than 97% accuracy

**Designing of pipelined RISC processors [[code]](https://github.com/shubhangb97/RISC-Processor-design)** <br> *Advisor- [Prof Virendra Singh](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viren/), IIT Bombay* <br>
- Designed and implemented datapath and control unit of a multicycle and a pipelined processor on an FPGA
- Implemented Turing complete IITB-RISC instruction set with instructions like conditional jump and store multiple
- Designed and included logic for hazard detection, data forwarding, stalling etc in the 6-stage pipeline design

**Music Genre Detection [[slides]](https://shubhangb97.github.io/files/Music_Genre_Report.pdf)** <br> *Advisor- [Prof Sunita Sarawagi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sunita/), IIT Bombay* <br>
- Classified music into 4 distinct genres using their MFC coefficients with over 85% accuracy on GTZAN dataset
- Used CNN based classifier and SVM’s, using bagging, boosting and other techniques performing a detailed comparison

**General Equalizer design [[report]](https://shubhangb97.github.io/files/Graphic_Equalizer.pdf)** <br> *Advisor- [Prof Ng Boon Poh](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=EBPNG), NTU Singapore* <br>
- Created an interactive equalizer system with3 bands and 25 levels adjustable gain using theTMS320C5515DSP
- Designed and optimized digital FIR filters to implement the band pass filtering in real time on the DSP

**Steganography using wavelet transform [[slides]](https://shubhangb97.github.io/files/Steganography.pdf)**<br> *Advisor- [Prof VM Gadre](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/vmgadre), IIT Bombay* <br>
- Coded a technique to encode data into an image / audio by using its discrete wavelet transform to hide data, without changing the original image or audio significantly
- Additionally implemented patch based DWT algorithm to encode/hide more data in the same image with better robustness to noise
- Presented the technique to participants at the MHRD-TEQIP workshop

**Low Cost Class D amplifier [[report]](https://shubhangb97.github.io/files/Low_cost_classD.pdf)**<br> *IIT Bombay* <br>
- Designed a high efficiency class D amplifier in a half bridge configuration using 2 power MOSFET’s
- Used PWM(Pulse width modulation) of audio signal with a low pass filter at output to minimize power losses and remove high frequency interference
- Used a bootstrap power supply to drive the floating high side MOSFET


**Noise cancelling headphones [[report]](https://shubhangb97.github.io/files/Noise_Cancelling.pdf)**<br> *IIT Bombay* <br>
- Designed an active noise cancelling system using a closed loop feedback system
- Designed and calibrated compensator and open loop gain using simulations to ensure stability of the system
