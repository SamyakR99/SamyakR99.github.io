**End to End Number Plate Recognition [[code]](https://github.com/ShubAn1901/License-Plate-Recognition)**

 Prof. Arjun Jain, IIT Bombay
- Implemented system for detecting bounding box and recognizing characters of a plate, with over 92% accuracy.
- Trained the system End to End, backpropagating on a single combined loss from both the box detector and digit
recognizer, over more than 250,000 images in the CCPD dataset

**Face Image De-Specularization**

 Prof. Cham Tat Jen, NTU Singapore
- Reviewed and analyzed issues with accurate face recognition in images with specular reflection
- Applied transfer learning from reflection removal domain to deal with specular reflection in face images

**Music Genre Detection [[slides]](https://shubhangb97.github.io/files/Music_Genre_Report.pdf)**

 Prof. Sunita Sarawagi, IIT Bombay
- Classified music into 4 distinct genres using their MFC coefficients with over 85% accuracy on GTZAN dataset
- Used CNN based classifier and SVM’s, using bagging, boosting and other techniques performing a detailed comparison

**Iris Recognition**

 | Prof. Suyash Awate [code] (July’18-Dec’18)
- Pre-processed the images using Adaptive histogram equalization and removed the pupil using segmentation
- Used PCA to reduce dimensionality of the data and applied Fisher’s LDA achieving more than 97% accuracy

**Designing of pipelined RISC processors**

 | Prof. Virendra Singh [code] (Oct’18-Dec’18)
- Designed and implemented datapath and control unit of a multicycle and a pipelined processor on an FPGA
- Implemented Turing complete IITB-RISC instruction set with instructions like conditional jump and store multiple
- Designed and included logic for hazard detection, data forwarding, stalling etc in the 6-stage pipeline design

**Music Genre Detection**

 | Prof. Sunita Sarawagi [slides] (July’18-Dec’18)
- Classified music into 4 distinct genres using their MFC coefficients with over 85% accuracy on GTZAN dataset
- Used CNN based classifier and SVM’s, using bagging, boosting and other techniques performing a detailed comparison

**General Equalizer design**

(Aug’19-Dec’19)Guide- Prof Ng Boon Poh,
- Created an interactive equalizer system with3 bandsand 25 levels adjustable gain using theTMS320C5515DSP
- Designed and optimized digital FIR filters to implement the band pass filtering in real time on the DSP

**Steganography using wavelet transform**

(Feb’19-Apr’19)Guide-Prof Vikram Gadre
- Coded a technique to encode data into an image / audio by using its discrete wavelet transform to hide data,without changingthe original image or audio significantly
- Also implemented patch based DWT algorithm to encode/hide more data in the same image with better robustness to noise

**Low Cost Class D amplifier**

(Mar’18-May’18)Guide-Prof Siddharth Tallur
- Designed a high efficiency class D amplifier in a half bridge configuration using 2 power MOSFET’s
- Used PWM(Pulse width modulation) of audio signal with a low pass filter at output to minimize power losses and remove high frequency interference
- Used a bootstrap power supply to drive the floating high side MOSFET


**Noise cancelling headphones**

(Jan’19-May’19)Guide- Prof Debraj Chakraborty
- Designed an active noise cancelling system using a closed loop feedback system
- Designed and calibrated compensator and open loop gain to ensure stability of the system
